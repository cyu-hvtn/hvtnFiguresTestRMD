test_cases.Rmd includes examples to test whether pt_plot() is working as expected. In each example, the footnote describes the expected output of the figure. There are two ways to set up for the Rmd file: 

1. Download everything from this repo and run create_report.R
2. Download test_cases.Rmd to /code under the standard pt_report folder and knit. This might be faster but not encouraged as the output pdf will include information from the PT report.
